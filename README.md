# Mini-Project_Data_Analysis
All the mini projects are based on Dataquest online learning. After completion of Dataquest learning track Data Science for python, all the mini projects are done for data anaysis purpose.

Project 1: Analyze android apps data from goole play store (A data set containing data about approximately 10,000 Android apps from Google Play; the data was collected in August 2018) and apple store (A data set containing data about approximately 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store; the data was collected in July 2017) to find mobile apps profile which will be profitable for the marketers. 

Project 2: In this project we're specifically interested in posts whose title begin with either 'ASK HN' or 'Show HK' cause users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question.
In addition, later on this project we're going to comapre these two types of post ('ASK HN' or 'Show HK') to determine whether 'ASK HN' or 'Show HK' receive more comments on average or posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average.
